  abstract={Buildings significantly consume fossil energy, leading to substantial carbon emissions contributing to global warming and rising sea levels. These environmental impacts pose serious challenges, necessitating a shift towards sustainable building designs. By integrating clean energy solutions into building architecture, we can reduce the environmental burden of emissions. This approach mitigates adverse effects on living organisms and ecosystems and promotes long-term sustainability and resilience in urban development. Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems represent one such approach for substituting fossil energy. However, implementing BIPV effectively necessitates comprehensive analysis considering numerous parameters and variables. This paper introduces building design strategies employing the BIPV approach. The decision-making process in designing alternatives utilizes parametric methods, recognized for their ability to yield optimization results for various variables through the development of design algorithms. The study focuses on the design of a studio building at the University of North Sumatra. Comparative analysis of the results obtained through parametric design aims to identify the most favorable design outcomes. The research includes developing a parameterized design algorithm, workflow, and assessment results for selecting optimal design alternatives. The results indicate that the placement of PV panels on the side area (PVOS) has more potential than placement on the top area (PVOT). Despite the PVOT area being observed to be 0.57% smaller than PVOS, PVOS shows a significant increase in total Incident Radiation (IR), average IR, and total Energy Generated by 137.14%, 128.40%, and 132.97%, respectively.},
