  title={Acoustic Ray Simulation},
  abstract={This study details the creation of a specialized auditorium model, inspired by Architectâ€™s Data by Neufert. Employing Grasshopper for algorithmic modeling, parameters were refined, emphasizing ray distribution simulation for acoustic analysis via Ray Pachyderm Acoustical Simulation. Data visualization, featuring a heat map, illustrates ray counts at each step for seats. In conclusion, this method offers insights into sound ray behavior in acoustics.},
