  title={NURTURE},
  abstract={This project aims to revitalize Singapore’s urban environment, tackling critical issues like food security and environmental sustainability, which are primary concerns in the country. By integrating education-focused communities with advanced technology, the pond-centric design, especially in housing placement, promotes sensory learning within the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) framework. The proposed design advocates for a self-sufficient strategy through both public and private housing, contributing significantly to Singapore’s 2030 goal of attaining 30% food self-sufficiency. This initiative marks a comprehensive shift towards sustainable living for future residents of Singapore.},
