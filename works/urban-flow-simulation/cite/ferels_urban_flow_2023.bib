  title={Urban Flow Simulation},
  abstract={This study analyzes wind flow through the Podomoro City development in West Jakarta using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The complex includes luxury and mid-to-high-end apartments, the Pullman Hotel, and the Tribeca Arcade, connecting the Central Park Mall to nearby buildings. The study simulates airflow across the site to understand how wind interacts with the structures and impacts the surrounding environment. The findings aim to provide insights for optimizing airflow, enhancing comfort, and reducing potential environmental issues in future design iterations.},
