  abstract={I was one of the tutors at the Computational Design Workshop held at ITB's Architecture Laboratory. Led by Aswin Indraprastha, PhD, the workshop introduced students to parametric design using Rhino and Grasshopper, as well as BIM applications with Revit. Participants gained hands-on experience with 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC routers, exploring their practical applications.},
