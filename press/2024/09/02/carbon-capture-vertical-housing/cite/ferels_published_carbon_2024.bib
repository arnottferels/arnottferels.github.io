  abstract={"Carbon Capture Vertical Housing" explores an innovative approach in formulating key criteria for vertical housing design, which is based on the principles of the circular economy. The book explores the intricacies of developing criteria that aim to design vertical housing structures with minimal carbon emissions and using prefabricated timber modular systems. By integrating circular economy concepts into the design process, the book seeks to revolutionize traditional approaches to urban housing development, offering sustainable solutions to environmental and climate change problems.

Through careful research and analysis, "Carbon Capture Vertical Housing" presents a comprehensive framework for designing sustainable vertical housing projects by prioritizing low carbon emissions and utilizing prefabricated wood modules. The book presents a blueprint for sustainable urban development that embraces innovation and ecological responsibility. This groundbreaking work is essential reading for architects, urban planners, and policymakers looking to spearhead sustainable housing initiatives in an era characterized by the urgent phenomena of environmental concerns and climate change.
