  abstract={This prototype, titled North Star, explores a conceptual design inspired by the star’s simple yet meaningful shape. The central point, resembling a pseudo-sphere with rays spreading out like evolving sound waves, symbolizes movement, speed, and balance. Using a lattice structure, the design reflects the star’s natural symmetry along the Z+ and Z- axes, creating a truss-like model that combines strength and elegance.},
